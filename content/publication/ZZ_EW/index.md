abstract: 'We have studied the emission of a Higgs boson off a Z boson in gluon fusion at the LHC. The study focusses on the parton-shower matching uncertainties at leading order that may have large non trivial effects since this process is a loop induced process. The study has been carried out using two different parton-showers, Sherpa and Pythia. 
The leading order matching has been also compared against the multijet-merged calculation done using Sherpa. In this sample the 0- and 1-jet matrix elements are merged together and matched to a parton-shower.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'This study focusses on the parton-shower matching uncertainties for the loop-induced process $pp\to ZH$.'
