By education, I'm just a theoretical physicist :mortar_board:, but my passions and expertises are actually way broader. 
Starting from an immense love for tech and programming :computer: up to developing general analyses to solve business problems :chart_with_upwards_trend:.

So, welcome to my personal blog :black_nib: where you'll also find bits of my life and education.
